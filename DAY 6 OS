Shortest Job First:- Till now, we were scheduling the processes according to their arrival time (in FCFS scheduling). However, SJF scheduling 
algorithm, schedules the processes according to their burst time.
In SJF scheduling, the process with the lowest burst time, among the list of available processes in the ready queue, is going to be scheduled next.
However, it is very difficult to predict the burst time needed for a process hence this algorithm is very difficult to implement in the system.

Advantages:
1)Maximum throughput
2)Minimum average waiting and turnaround time

Disadvantages:
1)May suffer with the problem of starvation
2)It is not implementable because the exact Burst time for a process can't be known in advance.
