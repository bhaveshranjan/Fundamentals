Computing Environments : When a problem is solved by the computer, during that computer uses many devices, arranged in different ways and which
work together to solve problems. This constitutes a computing environment where various number of computer devices arranged in different ways 
to solve different types of problems in different ways. In different computing environments computer devices are arranged in different ways and 
they exchange information in between them to process and solve problem. One computing environment consists of many computers other computational
devices, software and networks that to support processing and sharing information and solving task. Based on the organization of different 
computer devices and communication processes there exists multiple types of computing environments. 

Types of Computing Environments : There are the various types of computing environments. They are :

1: Personal Computing Environment
2: Time-Sharing Computing Environment
3: Client Server Computing Environment
4: Distributed Computing Environment
5: Grid Computing Environment
6: Cloud Computing Environment
7: Cluster Computing Environment
