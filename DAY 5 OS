A round robin is an arrangement of choosing all elements in a group equally in some rational order, usually from the top to the bottom of a list and 
then starting again at the top of the list and so on.

A simple way to think of round robin is that it is about "taking turns."

Round robin applications
While this definition is general, there are some specific applications for a round robin. We examine a few of these below.

Computer operations
In computer operations, round robin is used in a scheduling algorithm that distributes work evenly among all available resources. This ensures that no 
single resource is overworked, which can lead to errors and other issues down the line.

This is often described as round robin process scheduling.

Another example of round robin in computer operations is round robin DNS (or RRDNS), a method that allows multiple DNS records to be created for the 
same IP address.

This ensures that no matter how many users are accessing the same domain name, each user has equal access to information and services through round 
robin.
