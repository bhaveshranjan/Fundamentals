This is the simplest synchronization mechanism. This is a Software Mechanism implemented in User mode. This is a busy waiting solution which can be 
used for more than two processes.
In this mechanism, a Lock variable lockis used. Two values of lock can be possible, either 0 or 1. Lock value 0 means that the critical section is
vacant while the lock value 1 means that it is occupied.
A process which wants to get into the critical section first checks the value of the lock variable. If it is 0 then it sets the value of lock as 1 and
enters into the critical section, otherwise it waits.
