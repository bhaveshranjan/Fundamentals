Kernel is central component of an operating system that manages operations of computer and hardware. It basically manages operations of
memory and CPU time. It is core component of an operating system. Kernel acts as a bridge between applications and data processing 
performed at hardware level using inter-process communication and system calls. 

Kernel loads first into memory when an operating system is loaded and remains into memory until operating system is shut down again. 
It is responsible for various tasks such as disk management, task management, and memory management. 

It decides which process should be allocated to processor to execute and which process should be kept in main memory to execute. 
It basically acts as an interface between user applications and hardware. The major aim of kernel is to manage communication between 
software i.e. user-level applications and hardware i.e., CPU and disk memory. 

Objectives of Kernel: 

To establish communication between user level application and hardware. 

To decide state of incoming processes. 
 
To control disk management. 

To control memory management. 
 
To control task management.
